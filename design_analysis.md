# Design Analysis

This note records the reference-page analysis used to redesign Mingjun Wang's academic homepage.

## Bei Yu Homepage

| Design Element | Observation |
|---|---|
| Navigation | Traditional jemdoc side navigation, organized by identity and research categories. Links are compact, text-first, and highly scannable. |
| Hero layout | Photo and profile text are placed side by side in a table-like layout. The profile block prioritizes title, department, university, degrees, social links, and CV. |
| Section titles | Blue academic headings with simple horizontal separation. The visual system is restrained and information-driven. |
| About text | Dense academic prose with many contextual links. Paragraphs use a readable line height and compact spacing. |
| News / updates | The site favors dated, factual update lists. Content is precise, chronological, and easy to skim. |
| Awards / records | Information is best represented as compact tabular or list structures rather than decorative cards. |
| Color palette | Navy/blue links and headings, black text, white background, light gray separators. |
| Typography | Jemdoc-style academic typography, with compact body text and restrained headings. |

## Yao Lai Homepage

| Design Element | Observation |
|---|---|
| Navigation | Minimal sticky top navigation with a very small set of links. It uses subtle shadow/border and modern spacing. |
| Hero layout | A modern card-like profile area with text on the left and image on the right. Affiliation logo and CV/contact links are prominent but not oversized. |
| Education / honors | Uses compact rows with institution logos, degree text, and right-aligned dates. |
| Publication cards | Publications are card-based, with a left thumbnail/venue block and a right content area containing venue badge, title, authors, status badges, description, and links. |
| Typography | Modern sans-serif, body around 15-16px, compact headings around 18-20px, strong use of metadata styling. |
| Whitespace | Card spacing and section spacing create breathing room without wasting the page. |
| Color palette | Clean white background, deep blue links, small colorful venue badges, light gray borders. |

## Fusion Strategy

Mingjun Wang's homepage should combine Bei Yu's rigorous academic organization with Yao Lai's modern visual hierarchy. The redesign therefore uses:

- A compact sticky top navigation.
- A profile header with a compact rounded-rectangle portrait, affiliation logos, CV and scholar links.
- Bei Yu-style chronological News and awards table.
- Yao Lai-style education rows and publication cards.
- A narrow 960px container, 15px body text, and 22px section headings.
- No decorative numbering, no oversized typography, and no patent or under-review content.

## Second-Pass Refinement

- The profile image is displayed as a rounded-rectangle portrait rather than a circular crop. The supplied certificate-style photo is already tightly framed, so a circle enlarges the face too much and removes useful context.
- Publications are ordered by year first, then by author contribution and relevance to the research narrative. First-author and co-first AI4EDA papers lead the 2026 group, while the IEEE TCAD Early Access paper remains clearly visible in the same year group.
- Awards are ordered by year and then by public research/competition signal before scholarships. The duplicate EDA2/EDA² 2023 award from the CV is represented once.
- Each publication card explicitly marks whether the entry is a journal article or a conference paper, because the selected list mixes TCAD journal papers with conference papers.
- The CSS file is versioned in the generated HTML to avoid old GitHub Pages/browser caches preserving the previous circular portrait rule.
- The hero, research cards, and publication ordering now foreground AI4EDA and 3D IC design automation as the primary research identity, while keeping circuit representation learning and fault simulation as explicit, visible research themes.
